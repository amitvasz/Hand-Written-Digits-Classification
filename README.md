# Hand-Written-Digits-Classification
In this assignment, your task is to implement a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network and evaluate its
performance in classifying handwritten digits. For CSE574 students only: You will use the same network to
analyze a more challenging face dataset and compare the performance of the neural network against a deep
neural network using the TensorFlow library.
After completing this assignment, you are able to understand:
 How Neural Network works and use Feed Forward, Back Propagation to implement Neural Network?
 How to setup a Machine Learning experiment on real data?
 How regularization plays a role in the bias-variance tradeo?
 For CSE574 students only: How to use TensorFlow library to deploy deep neural networks and under-
stand how having multiple hidden layers can improve the performance of the neural network?
To get started with the exercise, you will need to download the supporting les and unzip its contents to
the directory you want to complete this assignment.
